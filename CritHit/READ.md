This is a Roll 20 API script that will generate random critical hit or miss effects.
Effects are customized by type of attack (melee, range or magic).

To access the script, type '!CritCards' in the chat box.  The script requires at least one command preceeded by --

Use !CritCards --help to display the help file.

!CritCards --hit or !CritCards --miss followed by the type of attack will display a result in the public chat. If a type of attack is not passed to the script it will assume melee.

Damage:  Critical Hit

You may immediately cast the same spell against any target within range, expending a spell slot as normal.
